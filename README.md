"JavaScript Projects
JavaScript projects are guided tutorials or javascript project ideas that help you sharpen your skills by building real applications, websites, games, components, etc. Sometimes you will find project ideas that just contain a title and a few sentences of what you should build.

Example: Build a counter with JavaScript that counts down the hours till the end of the year.

This format is good if you already have some experience and are just looking for some input.

JavaScript Projects for Beginners
However, if you are new to web development, it's often better if you look for JavaScript project examples with source code or specific JavaScript projects for beginners. These often contain a running demo application, a GitHub repository with the source code, and a step-by-step guide on how to build the project.

JavaScript Practice Projects
So for you to gain practice, I have listed nine awesome javascript project ideas that you can do to refresh your skills, learn new things about JS, and stay relevant in the future. All of them are based on pure JavaScript, some HTML, and some CSS. You can add them to your portfolio, show them to recruiters or potential employers, or keep them in your GitHub as references for future work. To be clear: This is not meant to teach you everything about JavaScript. There are perfect courses for you covering JS from A-Z. This is for building things. Getting your hands dirty. Working on your muscle memory."
